# Learning

This repository is for documentation of my personal progress with new programming languages.

> Eg.: I chose Python for first tests because it's a simple language that I already know to get better at using git and github (I started this repo locally and decided to upload it). So basically, for me, this first language was ment to get better at git begginer commands.

The idea is to create some basic programs (such as calculators) to explore the basics of a programming language.


### Future Programming Language Ideas
- [ ] Python (Work in Progress)
- [ ] Java
- [ ] C and C#
- [ ] Shell Script (and Bash)
- [ ] Docker Compose  
- [ ] To remember later...
> Note: No order defined, going by my personal interests.
